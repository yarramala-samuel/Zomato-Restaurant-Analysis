The primary objective of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing the overall rating of each restaurant, especially in the dynamic culinary landscape of Bengaluru. With over 12,000 restaurants in this IT hub, serving a diverse array of dishes, understanding the dynamics of the industry is crucial. Despite the increasing demand for restaurant services, competition remains fierce, particularly for new establishments offering similar cuisines.

Bengaluru, as the IT capital of India, witnesses a significant reliance on restaurant food due to time constraints for cooking. To address this, the analysis aims to study the demography of different locations and develop a predictive model for restaurant ratings.
